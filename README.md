# Playfair Cipher

This is an executable that will eventually take in a string from the command line and create a playfair cipher out a key and a file passed to it.

Currently in at the stage where im geenrating the digraphs needed for a playfair cipher

my next step will be to create a playfair cipher out of simple words and sentences

The plan for how to do the file in the future is to read the file line by line and feed it into the currently existing functions and bringing them together in a list.

The list can then be joined with a space in the middle and outputted to another file

Should be easy enough once I get past the hard part of actually generating the cipher.

Especially the table
